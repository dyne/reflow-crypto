\begin{abstract}
  Multidarkroom is a novel signature scheme supporting unlinkable
  signatures by multiple parties authenticated by means of a
  zero-knowledge credential scheme. Multidarkroom integrates with
  blockchains to ensure condidentiality, authenticity and availability
  even when credential issuing authorities are offline. We implement
  and evaluate a Multidarkroom smart contract for Zenroom and present
  an application related to multiple anonymous signatures by
  authenticated parties. Multidarkroom uses short and computationally
  efficient signatures and credentials whose verification takes the
  longest time to compute.

\section{Introduction}
Multi-party computation [] applied to the signing process [] allows
the issuance of signatures without requiring any of the participating
parties to disclose secret signing keys to each other, nor requires
the presence of a trusted third-party to receive them and compose the
signatures. However, established schemes have shortcomings. Some do
not provide the necessary efficiency, re-randomization, or blind
issuance properties necessary to implement the privacy preserving
features necessary for the application to trustless distributed
systems. Other schemes are prone to rogue-signature attacks [] in the
absence of authentication methods to grant that signatures are
produced by legitimate key holders.

The lack of efficient and privacy-preserving signature schemes impacts
distributed ledger platforms that support 'smart contracts' as well
distributed computing architectures where trust is not shared among
participants, but granted by one or more authorities through
credential issuance for the generation of non-interactive and
unlinkable proofs.

Multidarkroom uses short and computationally efficient signatures
composed of exactly two group elements that are linked to each
other. The size of the signature remains constant regardless of the
number of parties that are signing, while the credential size grows
linearly. Furthermure, after a one-time setup phase where the users
collect and aggregate a threshold number of verification keys from the
autorities, the attribute showing and verification O(1) in terms of
both cryptographic computations and communication of cryptographic
material, irrespective of the number of authorities.

Our evaluationof the Multiparty primities shows very promising
results. Verifiction takes about 10ms,  while signing a document is
about 3 times faster. 

\subsection{Contributions}

This paper makes three key contributions:

\begin{itemize}

\item We describe the credential scheme underlying Multidarkroom,
  including how key generation, issuance, aggregation and verification
  of credentials operate (Section II). The scheme is an application of
  the Coconut credential scheme [] that is general purpose and can be
  scaled to a fully distributed threshold issuance that is
  re-randomizable.

\item We describe the signature scheme underlying Multidarkroom,
  including how key generation, signing and verification operate
  (Section III). The scheme is an application of the BLS signature
  scheme [] fitted with features to grant the unlinkability of
  signatures and to secure it against rogue-signature attacks.

\item We use Multidarkroom to implement a Zencode scenario to be
  executed on and off-chain by the Zenroom VM, complete with functions
  for public credential issuance, signature session creation and
  multi-party non-interactive signing (Section III). We evaluate the
  performance and cost of this implementation on on-site and on-line
  platforms leveraging end-to-end encryption (Section VI).
